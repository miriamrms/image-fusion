This repository contains a project developed as part of a Program of Tutorial Education (PET) focusing on Computer Vision.

<h1>Image Fusion</h1>

<h3>Challenge:</h3>
<p>Build a program in OpenCV that does the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open two different images: a person's image (it can be your photo) and an image of an object or an animal. These images need to have the same size (resolution in terms of rows and columns).</li>
  <li>Using the blending function of OpenCV, generate another image resulting from the fusion of images, varying the weights of the person's image and the second image. Set the constant to zero and define the weight of the second image as 1 minus the weight of the person's image.</li>
  <li>Now use a trackbar to capture the weight of the person's image and display in real time the resulting fusion image. Notice how one image gradually transforms into the other.</li>
  <li>Save the original captured frame and the modified frames as PNG images.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Remember to always release resources at the end.</em></p>
